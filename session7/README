Puppet future:

puppet is working an new versions.
Most functionality is already available in stable code, but needs a certain config option to be available.

Attention:
this is for testing and evaluation only.
Code can change behavior without further notice on new releases.
Do not use experimental future features on production unless you fully understand the underlying code base.
