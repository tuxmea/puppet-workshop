Exported and Virtual Resources

Exported Resources

How to get information from one node to another (e.g. monitoring)

Solution:

within your node's declaration put in an exported resource.
When master compiles the catalog it will only store the information in puppetdb.

Exported resources can be any kind of resource type with double @ right in front:

e.g.
@@host {
 ...
}

On the node who needs the information:
Add the exported resource type collector.
When master compiles the catalog for this node it will put all data from puppetdb into the catalog

e.g.
Host <<| |>>


Virtual Resources:

declare once, use often.

You want to manage resource types based upon server functionality.
You decide to split your user management too.
Now you want a test system where you need all users.
But some users are on both server types.

This leads to duplicate resource.

Here you can use virtual resources.
When master compiles a catalog, it will "remeber" to realze this resource later on (when being told to do so).
A virtual resource has a single @ right in front of the type name:

e.g.
@user { ... }

At some point you need to decide which of your virtual resources you want to have (realize).
You can use the realice function or spaceship operator:

e.g.
realize(User[...])
User <| title == '...' |>
